# Command Line Customizations

Conner Swenberg's dev setup for the command line, built on top of [Oh-My-Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh).

## Installation

1. Install Oh-My-Zsh.
2. Clone this repo in your home directory (get there with just `cd`)
3. Add `ZSH_CUSTOM="~/.dotfiles"` to your `~/.zshrc` file
4. Run `ln -s ~/.dotfiles/.vimrc ~/.vimrc` to sync vim configurations (assuming no existing `~/.vimrc`)
5. Open a new tab and you're good to go!
